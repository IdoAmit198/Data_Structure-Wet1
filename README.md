# Data_Structure-Wet1

Winter 20-21. Done in collaboration with Yaal Lekach Avivi.

Inspired by the Corona-Virus times, we got an assignment in Data Structure course to implement the data structure for "Boom".
Boom is an application to manage recorded lectures for courses.

We implemented from scratch a Linked-List, AVL-Tree, and more other classes and data structures in C++.
